    <p>Surfing is the sport of riding waves in an upright or prone position. Surfers catch ocean, river, or man-made
        waves, and glide across the surface of the water until the wave breaks and loses its energy.
    </P>
    <P>In the ocean, wave riders stand up on surfboards and navigate the water - nearly parallel to the beach - toward
        the shore. There are four types of surfing waves: spilling waves, plunging waves, surging waves, and collapsing
        waves.</p>
    <p>The ultimate goal of surfing is to ride and progress on the unbroken part of the wave using a surfboard.
        Nevertheless, beginners can learn to surf in the whitewater part of the wave.</p>
