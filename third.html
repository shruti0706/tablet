    <p>Boat racing is a sport in which boats, or other types of watercraft, race on water. Boat racing powered by oars
        is recorded as having occurred in ancient Egypt, and it is likely that people have engaged in races involving
        boats and other water-borne craft for as long as such watercraft have existed.
    </P>
    <P>There are three broad categories of boat racing which define how the watercraft are powered. Self-propelled,
        human powered boats; wind (sail) powered boats; and motorised, frequently referred to as motorboats or
        powerboats.</p>
