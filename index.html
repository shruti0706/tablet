    <p>Scuba diving is perhaps the best way to explore the fantastic underwater world, getting up close with the wonders
        and the secrets of this marine universe, with its breathtakingly colourful and diverse inhabitants. Floating
        below the azure waters, you are in an ethereal – sometimes hostile – environment, with a limited supply of air
        on your back and with only your fellow divers as your lifelines. Over the years and the decades, scuba diving
        has evolved into a non-competitive but a very exciting adventure sport.

    <P> SCUBA is the short form of ‘Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus’. It was developed in the mid-1940s by
        the world famous underwater explorer and conservationist, Jacques-Yves Cousteau (with more than a little help
        from Émile Gagnan), for the French Navy during the Second World War. After the war, however, diving turned into
        a recreational sport, which has since been taken up by millions worldwide.</p>
