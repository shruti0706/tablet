    <p>Parasailing, also known as parascending or parakiting, is a recreational kiting activity where a person is towed
        behind a vehicle (usually a boat) while attached to a specially designed canopy wing that resembles a parachute,
        known as a parasail wing.
    </P>
    <P>The manned kite's moving anchor may be a car, truck, or boat. The harness attaches the pilot to the parasail,
        which is connected to the boat, or land vehicle, by the tow rope. The vehicle then drives off, carrying the
        parascender (or wing) and person into the air. If the boat is powerful enough, two or three people can parasail
        behind it at the same time. The parascender has little or no control over the parachute. The activity is
        primarily a fun ride, not to be confused with the sport of paragliding.
